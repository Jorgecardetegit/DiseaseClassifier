# DiseaseClassifier: Computer Vision in Plant Health Detection 🌱🧠

This project focuses on developing an application to identify whether plants are healthy or affected by diseases. The main approach will be to use computer vision techniques to build a Deep Learning Model which is able to classify the images correctly. 

## About the Project
### Technologies involved

- Computer Vision (Python, C++) 🧠
- Backend Development with FastAPI (Python) 🚀
- Frontend Development with React JS (Javascript) 💻
- Mobile App Development (Swift) 📱

### The Dataset
I'll be working with the PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle, a goldmine of plant images. It features images of various plants of vegetables commonly found in gardens and farms, including Apple, Blueberry, Corn, Tomato, and many more. Images are classified in healthy versions of the plant and unhealthy versions which can include different type of diseases.
