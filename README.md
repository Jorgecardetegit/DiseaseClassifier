# DiseaseClassifier: Computer Vision in Plant Health Detection 🌱🧠

Welcome to the DiseaseClassifier project, a fascinating journey into the world of deep learning. If you're a student eager to explore the realms of artificial intelligence and computer vision, you're in the right place. Our project focuses on developing an application to identify whether plants are healthy or affected by diseases, using the fantastic Kaggle dataset, PlantVillage.

## About the Project
### Learning Opportunity
This project offers an incredible learning experience in the following domains:

- Deep Learning (Python, C++)
- Backend Development with FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend Development with React JS (Javascript)
- Mobile App Development (Swift)

### The Dataset
We'll be working with the PlantVillage dataset, a goldmine of plant images. It features various vegetables commonly found in gardens and farms, including Apple, Blueberry, Corn, Tomato, and many more.

## Key Components
### 1. Model Construction 🧠
Dive into the world of deep learning and build a powerful model capable of discerning plant health from images. You'll experiment with Python and even explore some C++ for performance optimization.

### 2. FastAPI for Backend 🚀
Learn how to create a robust backend with FastAPI, a popular Python framework. Understand the intricacies of handling requests and serving machine learning predictions.

### 3. Web Development with React JS 💻
Immerse yourself in frontend development using React JS. Build an intuitive web interface where users can upload images and witness the AI-powered plant health assessment in action.

### 4. Mobile App Development with Swift 📱
Take your newfound knowledge to the mobile realm. Develop a Swift-based mobile app that brings plant health detection to smartphones, making it accessible on the go.

## Your Learning Journey
This project is your playground to experiment, learn, and grow your skills. It's not just about building an application; it's about building your expertise in deep learning, web development, and mobile app development.

Explore, make mistakes, and ask questions along the way. The DiseaseClassifier project is your stepping stone to becoming a proficient AI and software developer. 🌱👩‍💻👨‍💻
